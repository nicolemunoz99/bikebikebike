# About BikeBikeBike
BikeBikeBike is a full-stack app that tracks wear on bicycle components by pulling in a user's ride data (miles and hours) for 
each of the user's bikes from [Strava](http://strava.com). Users create a BikeBikeBike account, sign in to their Strava account
and grant BikeBikeBike permissions via OAuth 2.0, which allows the BikeBikeBike to make requests to [Strava](http://strava.com)'s API on the user's behalf.
